- Browserify bundling
- jQuery and Bootstrap for styling
- Gulp build that:

    -- lints JSX and JS via ESLint  
    -- bundles JS and CSS files  
    -- migrates the built app to the dist folder

- Build with node.js so that will:

    -- runs a dev webserver  
    -- opens your browser at the dev URL  
    -- reloads the browser upon save
